# React.js
All these things are actually maintained in the

JavaScript world and all the updation of the

UI is actually handled by DoM.

So UI is updated via the DOM, while all of

your variables are actually in the state in the JavaScript.

So the problem that it was, there

was actually the problem of there was

no sync between JavaScript and the DOM.


nd you can start either by directly going

in depth or by directly making the projects.

So when you go directly in depth, you come

to the words like Babel or you come to

the words like react, fiber, virtual dom, diffing algorithm,

hydration tree, shaking all these concepts and you first

understand the concept and then you try to make

projects like todo's and calculators and background changers

and whatnot, and you apply these concepts.

Another approach is let's just

directly build the projects.

Let's just say we build a

background changer or a calculator. And why this?

We learn each topic, for example, in to

do we learn about the virtual Dom maybe,

or calculator, maybe the diffing algorithm.

So each project teaches you one or the

other concept, and then the same thing happens.

The project.

## 126. Create your own react library and JSX

The video provides a detailed walkthrough on creating a basic version of React from scratch using plain JavaScript, aiming to demystify how React works under the hood. The instructor emphasizes that React is not magic but rather a collection of JavaScript code and algorithms designed to simplify DOM manipulation. The tutorial focuses on building a simple React-like library that can render elements into the DOM, mimicking React's core functionality.

Key Points Covered:
React Basics: React is essentially JavaScript that helps in UI manipulation. It uses algorithms to make DOM updates easier and more consistent.

Creating a Custom React:

The instructor starts by creating a basic HTML file and a JavaScript file to mimic React's functionality.

A simple render function is created to inject elements into the DOM, similar to how React renders components.

The render function takes an element and a container, creates a DOM element, sets its attributes, and appends it to the container.

React Element Structure:

React treats everything as an object. Elements are created with a type (e.g., h1, a), props (attributes), and children (content).

The instructor demonstrates how to create a React-like element object and render it into the DOM.

Optimizing the Code:

The code is optimized by looping through props to dynamically set attributes, making it more reusable and scalable.

A for...in loop is used to iterate over the props and set them on the DOM element.

Integration with Vite:

The custom React code is integrated into a Vite project to demonstrate how it can work alongside React.

The instructor shows how to render custom elements using the same principles as React, including handling JSX-like syntax.

React's JSX Under the Hood:

JSX is explained as a syntax sugar that gets converted into React.createElement calls.

The instructor demonstrates how React converts JSX into JavaScript objects, which are then rendered into the DOM.

Rendering Variables and Expressions:

The video explains how React evaluates expressions inside curly braces {} and renders them as part of the DOM.

Variables and expressions like 2 + 2 or username are rendered dynamically in the DOM.

Key Takeaways:
React is not magic; itâ€™s a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation.

By understanding how React works under the hood, developers can become better at using it.

The tutorial provides a foundational understanding of how React renders elements, handles props, and manages the DOM.

The video concludes by encouraging viewers to experiment with the code and deepen their understanding of React's core concepts.

The instructor also encourages viewers to support the channel by leaving comments and engaging with the content, promising more videos on advanced React topics in the future.

## 127. Why you need hooks and project

state 

The video focuses on building a basic React project to demonstrate the concept of **state** in React. The instructor walks through creating a simple counter application to illustrate how state management works and why it is essential in React development.

### Key Points Covered:
1. **Introduction to State**:
   - The instructor explains that React is a UI library that manages how the UI updates and re-renders based on changes in data.
   - State is introduced as a mechanism in React that allows components to re-render when data changes.

2. **Building a Counter App**:
   - A simple counter app is created with two buttons: one to increment the counter and another to decrement it.
   - Initially, the counter is implemented using plain JavaScript variables, but it fails to update the UI when the variable changes.

3. **Using React State**:
   - The `useState` hook is introduced to manage the counter's state.
   - The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
   - The instructor demonstrates how to update the state using the `setCounter` function, which triggers a re-render of the component.

4. **State Initialization**:
   - The initial value of the state is set using the `useState` hook (e.g., `useState(15)` initializes the counter to 15).
   - The state can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, arrays, and objects.

5. **Handling State Updates**:
   - The instructor shows how to increment and decrement the counter using the `setCounter` function.
   - A common issue with state updates is **batching**, where React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for performance optimization.

6. **Callback in State Updates**:
   - To avoid batching issues when updating state based on the previous state, a callback function can be passed to the state updater function (e.g., `setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)`).
   - This ensures that the state updates are applied sequentially, even when multiple updates are triggered in quick succession.

7. **Real-World Use Case**:
   - The instructor emphasizes that state management is crucial for building dynamic and responsive UIs in React.
   - The counter app demonstrates how state allows components to react to user interactions and update the UI accordingly.

### Key Takeaways:
- **State** is a core concept in React that enables components to re-render when data changes.
- The `useState` hook is used to declare and manage state in functional components.
- State updates can be batched for performance optimization, but a callback function can be used to ensure sequential updates when needed.
- Understanding state is essential for building interactive and dynamic UIs in React.

The video concludes with the instructor encouraging viewers to practice state management and explore more React concepts in upcoming videos. The instructor also requests support from viewers by leaving comments and sharing the video.
react

came up with the concept known as state.

And state is a unique thing in the react,

which actually simply just is getting constantly monitored.

And any change in the state re

renders the UI on the web.

And this is what the state is being designed for.

Any change in the state will re render the web page.



## 128. Virtual DOM, Fibre and reconciliation

The video dives into the **core concepts of React's architecture**, focusing on **Virtual DOM**, **Reconciliation**, and **React Fiber**. The instructor explains how React optimizes UI updates and rendering performance, providing a foundational understanding of how React works under the hood.

### Key Points Covered:
1. **Virtual DOM**:
   - React creates a virtual representation of the actual DOM, which allows it to efficiently update the UI.
   - Instead of re-rendering the entire page, React compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only the parts that have changed.

2. **Reconciliation**:
   - Reconciliation is the algorithm React uses to compare the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and determine what needs to be updated.
   - This process ensures that only the necessary changes are applied, improving performance.

3. **React Fiber**:
   - React Fiber is the new core algorithm introduced to improve React's performance, especially for animations and incremental rendering.
   - Fiber allows React to split rendering work into smaller chunks, spread over multiple frames, and prioritize updates based on their importance.
   - Key features of Fiber include the ability to pause, abort, and reuse work, as well as prioritize different types of updates.

4. **Batching Updates**:
   - React batches state updates to optimize performance. Instead of updating the DOM immediately, React groups multiple updates and applies them together.
   - This batching process can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, but it can be controlled using callbacks in state updates.

5. **React Core and Source Code**:
   - The instructor explores the React source code on GitHub, highlighting key packages like `react-dom` and `react-core`.
   - Key concepts like hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) and JSX are explained by referencing the actual React source code.

6. **React Fiber Architecture**:
   - Fiber introduces a more flexible and efficient way to handle updates, allowing React to prioritize tasks like animations and user interactions.
   - The Fiber architecture enables features like incremental rendering, which improves the responsiveness of React applications.

7. **Real-World Implications**:
   - Understanding these concepts is crucial for optimizing React applications, especially for large-scale projects.
   - The instructor emphasizes that these foundational concepts are not just theoretical but are actively used in React's core implementation.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Virtual DOM** and **Reconciliation** are key to React's efficient UI updates.
- **React Fiber** is the modern core algorithm that improves performance by enabling incremental rendering and task prioritization.
- **Batching updates** helps optimize performance but requires careful handling in certain scenarios.
- Exploring the React source code provides deeper insights into how React works under the hood.

The video concludes by encouraging viewers to explore React's source code and documentation to build a stronger understanding of its architecture. The instructor also hints at diving into more practical coding examples in the next video.

## 129. Tailwind and Props in reactjs

In this video, the focus was on configuring **Tailwind CSS** in a React application and understanding the concept of **props** in React components. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

### 1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**
   - The setup involves installing Tailwind CSS as a development dependency using npm.
   - A `tailwind.config.js` file is created to define where Tailwind should look for content (e.g., HTML, JSX, TSX files).
   - Tailwind generates only the necessary CSS, making it efficient.
   - The `index.css` file is updated with Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, `@tailwind utilities`) to enable Tailwind's functionality.

### 2. **Creating a React Component**
   - A **Card** component was created to demonstrate modularization in React.
   - The component was styled using Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-3xl`, `bg-green-500`, `p-3`, `rounded-md`).
   - The component was imported and used in the `App.jsx` file, showcasing how React components can be reused.

### 3. **Understanding Props**
   - **Props** (short for properties) allow data to be passed into components, making them dynamic and reusable.
   - Props are passed as key-value pairs when a component is used (e.g., `<Card username="Hitesh" />`).
   - Inside the component, props can be accessed as an object. For example:
     ```jsx
     const Card = ({ username, post }) => {
       return <h1>{username}</h1>;
     };
     ```
   - **Default values** can be assigned to props to handle cases where no value is passed:
     ```jsx
     const Card = ({ username = "Hc", post = "Not assigned yet" }) => {
       return <h1>{username}</h1>;
     };
     ```

### 4. **Destructuring Props**
   - Destructuring props at the top of the component makes the code cleaner and avoids repetitive `props.` syntax.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const Card = ({ username, post }) => {
       return <h1>{username}</h1>;
     };
     ```

### 5. **Handling Complex Data**
   - Props can pass more than just strings; they can pass arrays, objects, or even functions.
   - For complex data, it's better to define a variable first and then pass it as a prop:
     ```jsx
     const userData = { username: "Hitesh", post: "Staff Engineer" };
     <Card {...userData} />;
     ```

### 6. **Best Practices**
   - Use **default values** for props to make components more robust.
   - Avoid conditional checks inside the component for missing props; instead, provide default values upfront.
   - Modularize components (e.g., Header, Footer, Card) for better code organization and reusability.

### 7. **Key Takeaways**
   - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that generates only the necessary styles.
   - Props enable components to be dynamic and reusable by passing data into them.
   - Destructuring props and providing default values are best practices for writing scalable React components.
   - Modularizing code into smaller components (e.g., Card, Header, Footer) is essential for building maintainable React applications.

### 8. **Assignment**
   - Create additional components (e.g., Header, Footer) and practice passing props to make them dynamic and reusable.

This video provided a solid foundation for configuring Tailwind CSS and using props in React, emphasizing modularization and best practices for scalable code.

## 130. Building a react project bgChanger
The passage describes the process of creating a simple background color changer application using React and Tailwind CSS. The developer outlines the steps to set up the project, including installing dependencies, configuring Tailwind CSS, and structuring the React components. The core functionality revolves around using React's `useState` hook to manage and update the background color dynamically. Buttons are created to change the background color, and the developer explains how to handle state updates and event handling in React. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of understanding basic concepts like state management and event propagation, while also encouraging learners to practice by adding more color options and improving the UI. The goal is to build a foundational understanding of React and Tailwind CSS through hands-on practice.




## 131. useEffect, useRef and useCallback with 1 project

The passage describes the process of building a **password generator application** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The developer walks through the setup, UI creation, and implementation of core functionality using React hooks like `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. The app dynamically generates passwords based on user-selected criteria (length, numbers, special characters) and allows users to copy the password to their clipboard. The developer emphasizes the importance of **optimization** (e.g., memoization with `useCallback`) and **user experience** (e.g., providing feedback when copying). The tutorial also highlights the use of **React hooks** to manage state, handle side effects, and interact with the DOM. The project serves as a foundational example of how to build interactive, optimized React applications while introducing key React concepts. The developer encourages learners to explore the hooks further and practice building similar projects.


<!-- npm create vite@latest -->

This `useref` is a crazy powerful hook.
If you want to grab anything from the windows, not
only just this, I'll talk probably at the end of
the series that how crazy this hook can be.

In React, `useCallback` is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It helps optimize performance by ensuring that a function is not recreated on every render unless its dependencies change. 
This is particularly useful when passing functions as props to child components that might re-render unnecessarily.


### Syntax:
```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // callback logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

- **Callback function**: The function you want to memoize.

- **Dependencies**: An array of values that, when changed, will cause the function to be recreated. If none of the dependencies change, the function will stay the same across renders.

### Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // This function is memoized and will only be recreated if `count` changes
  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <Child increment={increment} />
    </div>
  );
}

function Child({ increment }) {
  console.log('Child rendered!');
  return <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>;
}

export default Parent;
```

### Explanation:
- `increment` is passed as a prop to the `Child` component.
- Without `useCallback`, every render of the `Parent` component would recreate the `increment` function, causing the `Child` component to re-render.
- By using `useCallback`, the `increment` function will only be recreated if `count` changes. This prevents unnecessary re-renders of the `Child` component if `count` hasn't changed. 

In this example, `Child` will only log "Child rendered!" when the `increment` function changes (i.e., when the `count` changes).

`useEffect` is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs by specifying dependencies. It can also clean up side effects when a component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.

### Syntax:
```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic here
  return () => {
    // Cleanup (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]); // Optional dependency array
```

- Runs **after render**.
- Runs **conditionally** based on dependencies.
- Can include a **cleanup function** to clean up side effects when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again.

`useRef` is a React hook that provides a way to persist values across renders without causing re-renders. It's primarily used for accessing and interacting with DOM elements or storing mutable values that do not trigger re-renders when changed.

### Syntax:
```js
const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
```

- **`myRef.current`**: You access the current value stored in the ref via `.current`.
- **Initial value**: You can pass an initial value (like `null` for DOM elements or any other value for non-DOM usage).

### Use Cases:
1. **Accessing DOM elements**: For example, focusing an input field.
2. **Storing mutable values**: Keeping track of a value that should not trigger re-renders.

### Example:
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function FocusInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus(); // Focuses the input element
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FocusInput;
```

### Key Points:
- `useRef` does not cause re-renders when the value changes.
- It is commonly used for DOM references and storing mutable values across renders.



## 132. Custom hooks in react | Currency Project

It looks like you're describing a React-based currency converter project that emphasizes **component reusability** and modularity. Here's a summary of the key concepts:

1. **Reusable Components:**
   - Components like the input box, currency dropdown, and button are designed to be reusable. They handle specific tasks (e.g., displaying an input, swapping currencies, selecting currency types) but don't have any hard-coded logicâ€”everything is dynamic and configurable via props.
   
2. **State Management and Props:**
   - Props are passed into components to customize their behavior (e.g., currency options, amount, and whether a field is enabled or disabled).
   - State hooks are used to track changes (e.g., the amount entered by the user, the selected currency).

3. **API Integration:**
   - The currency converter fetches real-time conversion rates from an API. This allows the app to adjust the conversion based on live data.
   - The API returns currency conversion rates (e.g., INR to USD), which are displayed to the user.

4. **TailwindCSS for Styling:**
   - TailwindCSS is used to style the app, making it responsive and easy to tweak without worrying too much about custom CSS.

5. **Functional Components:**
   - Functional components are used throughout the project, making it easier to handle the reusability and state management in a clean, concise way.

The overall goal is to design a set of components that can be reused across different parts of the app (e.g., input fields for different currencies), minimizing redundant code. This approach helps improve maintainability and scalability, especially when building larger applications.


The discussion covers the process of building a custom React hook (`useCurrencyInfo`) to handle API calls for currency data and converting amounts between different currencies. Here's a summarized breakdown of what was covered:

1. **Custom Hook Creation**:
   - Instead of writing all logic in `App.js`, a custom hook (`useCurrencyInfo`) is created for cleaner code organization.
   - This hook will handle API requests and store the fetched currency data in the state using `useState`.

2. **Fetching Data with `useEffect`**:
   - Inside the hook, `useEffect` is used to trigger the API call whenever the currency parameter changes (e.g., USD, INR).
   - The data is fetched using `fetch` (alternatively `axios` could be used) and the response is processed and stored in the state.
   - The fetched data is stored in a state variable, but only the required portion (such as `USD` or `INR` value) is passed into the state, not the entire API response.

3. **Returning the Data**:
   - The hook returns the currency data (e.g., `USD`, `INR`) as an object.
   - The returned data will be used in `App.js` to display the conversion results.

4. **Handling Input and Conversion**:
   - In `App.js`, states for `amount`, `from`, `to`, and `convertedAmount` are set up.
   - A user can provide the amount and select the currencies (from and to), and the converted amount will be calculated using the fetched data from the custom hook.

5. **UI and Accessibility**:
   - The labels for the input fields are made more accessible by using `htmlFor` to link labels to the corresponding input fields.
   - Optionally, `useId` hook is used to generate unique IDs for form inputs to ensure proper accessibility.

6. **Working with Currency Data**:
   - The custom hook returns currency data that is used in the main `App.js` to display options in a dropdown.
   - The keys of the currency data (such as USD, EUR, INR) are extracted using `Object.keys()` to populate the options in the dropdowns.

The key takeaway is that organizing API calls and logic in custom hooks helps in maintaining cleaner and more scalable code, avoiding clutter in the main app component.

Sure! Here's a summary of the process described in the video:

The tutorial walks through the creation of a currency converter application using React. It covers several essential concepts such as components, state management, hooks, and custom hooks, among others. 

### Key steps in the process:

1. **Component Structure:**
   - The application begins with setting up a basic structure for the currency converter UI. It includes input fields for the amount, from and to currency, and buttons to trigger conversion or swap operations.

2. **State Management:**
   - The state tracks the amount, selected currency values (from and to), and the converted amount. The `useState` hook is utilized for managing these states.

3. **Currency Conversion Logic:**
   - A custom hook is designed to fetch currency data (like exchange rates) from an API. The hook calls a URL based on the selected currencies and processes the response to extract relevant data, such as conversion rates.
   - The conversion logic is implemented in a simple function that multiplies the amount by the exchange rate to convert it.

4. **Event Handling:**
   - The form submission is handled with `onSubmit`, which prevents default behavior and calls the conversion function.
   - The currency swap functionality is implemented to switch the selected currencies, updating the from and to states.

5. **UI Design:**
   - TailwindCSS classes are used to style the components and inputs. The UI dynamically updates based on user input, with changes reflected in the currency values and conversion result.
   - There's a swap button that triggers the state changes for currency swapping and updates the corresponding fields.

6. **JavaScript Best Practices:**
   - The tutorial stresses best practices, such as properly managing state and writing reusable components.
   - It also emphasizes the importance of scalability in larger projects, where components and data flow need to be flexible and maintainable.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - The video touches on how to debug errors, especially with handling state changes and ensuring the UI updates correctly when the user interacts with input fields and buttons.

8. **Final Implementation:**
   - The final working application allows users to input an amount, select currencies, convert between them, and see the result displayed in the desired format. It also includes currency swapping functionality.

Throughout the tutorial, the importance of organizing code into reusable components, leveraging React hooks, and ensuring scalability in development is emphasized.

### Conclusion:
The video offers a step-by-step guide to building a functional and scalable currency converter application in React, showcasing key concepts like state management, custom hooks, and best practices for building maintainable code.

## 133. React router crash course

It looks like you're following a tutorial on setting up React Router v6 with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

1. **React Router Setup:**
   - Installed `react-router-dom` for routing.
   - Used `createBrowserRouter` to define routes.
   - Implemented a `Layout` component with `<Outlet />` to maintain a consistent header and footer across pages.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Created a `components` directory with `Header.jsx` and `Footer.jsx`.
   - Created a `Layout.jsx` file to wrap the appâ€™s content while keeping the header and footer consistent.

3. **Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
   - Installed and set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Updated `index.css` to include Tailwind directives.

4. **Router Provider Integration:**
   - Configured the router in `main.jsx` using `RouterProvider`.
   - Defined a route structure where the `Layout` component wraps the content.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Implement dynamic routes, URL parameters, and GitHub API integration.
   - Explore `react-router-dom` features like `useParams` and `useNavigate`.


It looks like you're working on React Router and implementing navigation with `Route`, `Link`, and `NavLink`. You're structuring your project with components for `Home`, `About`, `Contact`, and `User`, and integrating Tailwind CSS for styling.

Here are some key takeaways from what you've covered:
1. **Basic Routing**: Using `<Route>` components inside a `Routes` wrapper to define paths and corresponding components.
2. **Nested Routing**: Utilizing the "sandwiching" concept (wrapping multiple routes) to create sub-routes.
3. **Navigation with `Link` and `NavLink`**: Using `Link` for basic navigation and `NavLink` to highlight active routes dynamically.
4. **Component Structure**: Keeping reusable UI elements like `Header`, `Footer`, and individual pages structured in separate files.

### Next Steps:
- **Implement Contact Page**: You've left it as an exercise, but it's a straightforward task following the same structure as `Home` and `About`.
- **User Dynamic Route (`/user/:id`)**: If you want to fetch user details dynamically, you can set up a route like `/user/:id` and extract `id` using `useParams()`.
- **404 Page**: Create a fallback route with `path="*"` to catch undefined paths.

Do you need help with any specific part, like dynamic routing or state management in your React Router setup?

Here's a concise summary of the content:  

This tutorial covers React Router concepts, focusing on dynamic routing, data fetching, and preloading strategies. It explains how to structure nested routes using the "sandwiching" concept and dynamically extract URL parameters with `useParams`. The example involves a GitHub component that fetches and displays data (e.g., follower count, avatar) using `useEffect` and `fetch`.  

To optimize performance, the tutorial introduces React Router's `loader` function and `useLoaderData` hook. Instead of fetching data within the component, data is preloaded at the route level, improving efficiency. This technique is similar to Next.js's automatic data preloading.  

The tutorial concludes by highlighting additional React Router features, such as `useSubmit` and `useRoute`, and hints at future lessons on authentication and navigation redirection.

## 134. 12 Context API in react | get the concept


The content you've shared discusses React's state management concepts, focusing on the **Context API** as a solution for sharing global data between components. Here's a summary:

---

### **React: Handling Data Flow with Context API**

React enables data handling through **props** and **state**. Props are used to pass data between components, while state stores local data within a component. However, as an app grows, passing data across multiple levels of nested components can become cumbersome. This is where **state management** comes into play.

### **Problem with Nested Components**
When components are nested deeply, passing data from one component to another becomes inefficient, especially when intermediary components donâ€™t use the data but still need to pass it down. This can lead to unnecessary re-renders and makes the code harder to maintain.

### **Solution: Centralized State with Context API**
To solve this, we can use a **centralized state** approach, where data is managed in one place (a global store) and can be accessed by any component that needs it. This is achieved through React's **Context API**. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Create a Context**: The `createContext` function is used to create a context, which acts as a global store for the data.
2. **Provider**: The **Context Provider** component wraps the app and makes the context accessible to all components within its tree. Any child component can then consume the context.
3. **Consumer**: Components that need the data can "consume" it from the context without having to rely on props passed down through each layer of components.

### **Context API Workflow**
- **Create Context**: Create a new context using `React.createContext()`.
- **Context Provider**: Wrap the root component with the Context Provider to provide access to the data globally.
- **Consume Context**: Use the `useContext` hook to access the data from the context in any child component.

### **Code Walkthrough**
- The tutorial walks through the setup of a small app using the Context API. The components include a **Login component** and a **Profile component**. 
- The **Login component** handles user input (username, password), while the **Profile component** displays the username.
- Without context, you would pass the data through multiple layers of components, but with context, you can access the data directly from the global store without the need for prop drilling.

### **Steps to Implement Context API**:
1. **Create a context** (e.g., `userContext`).
2. **Create a provider** (e.g., `userContextProvider`) that holds the state (e.g., user data).
3. **Wrap the root component** (e.g., `App`) with the provider to give all child components access to the context.
4. **Consume the context** in any child component using the `useContext` hook to access and display or modify data.

---

By using the **Context API**, React developers can avoid the problems of prop drilling and create a cleaner, more maintainable way to manage shared state across components.

In this tutorial, the focus is on setting up **React Context** to manage global state across an application, avoiding prop drilling.

### Key Points:
1. **Context Creation**: 
   - The `createContext` method is used to create a context that holds a state, which in this case is a `user` object.
   - This context provides a provider that can be used to wrap the entire application or specific parts of it.


2. **User Context Provider**: 
   - A `UserContext` is created using `createContext()`. This holds `user` data and a method (`setUser`) to modify it.
   - The `UserContext.Provider` wraps around the application's components to make `user` and `setUser` available globally.

3. **Accessing Data**: 
   - Components that need access to the `user` data can use `useContext(UserContext)` to get the data (like the `user` or `setUser`).
   - In the example, the login component is responsible for updating the `user` state using `setUser`.

4. **Conditional Rendering**: 
   - Components can conditionally render UI based on whether the `user` is set or not.
   - For instance, a profile component checks if `user` exists and displays different content based on that.

5. **Avoiding Prop Drilling**: 
   - This setup eliminates the need to manually pass data through props to deeply nested components. Any component wrapped by the provider can access the global state directly via `useContext`.

6. **Updating State**: 
   - When data needs to be updated, such as logging in, the state is updated using the `setUser` function, which updates the context and reflects changes across all components using it.

7. **Boilerplate Setup**: 
   - The process involves setting up `createContext`, creating a provider, and wrapping the app to make the data accessible. After this, components can access and modify the state globally without prop drilling.

This pattern is a powerful way to manage state in React, especially when dealing with global data like user authentication, settings, or other shared state.

## 135. Build a dark mode light mode in reactjs with context api

Here's a summary of the video content:

The speaker discusses using React's Context API to create a theme toggler with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to design a simple theme toggler that controls the theme for a card component, allowing for a light or dark theme toggle. The video covers how to create the context and provider for managing the theme, and it introduces a new way of writing code with a custom hook for easier state management.

The speaker starts by explaining the process of setting up a React project using Vite, installing Tailwind CSS, and configuring it for dark mode. The core of the video is about creating and managing context through the theme context, which holds the theme state and a toggle function. The components (`Card` and `ThemeButton`) are created, with a theme toggle button that will control the dark/light theme of the card. The context is then set up in a way that allows both components to be aware of the theme state.

By using the context API and hooks together, the video demonstrates an efficient way to manage shared state without having to pass context data manually into every component. The speaker also clarifies that the goal is to simplify code by using a custom hook (`useTheme`), so components can easily access the theme context without needing to import it every time.

In conclusion, the speaker highlights the power of combining context and custom hooks to improve code maintainability and ease of use when building React applications.

This tutorial walks through the process of implementing a theme toggle (light/dark mode) in a React application using the Context API, along with hooks like `useContext` and `useEffect`.

### Key Steps & Concepts:

1. **Setting Up the Context**: 
   - The `createContext` function is used to create a context for managing the theme (light or dark).
   - A custom hook (`useTheme`) is created to manage the theme state and allow components to access and update the theme mode.

2. **Context Provider**:
   - The `ThemeProvider` component wraps the entire app, making the theme state available to all components. It provides the theme value (`themeMode`) and functions (`darkTheme`, `lightTheme`) to change the theme.
   - The provider is set up in the `App.js` file, passing the theme state and functions to children components.

3. **Using `useEffect` for Theme Updates**:
   - A `useEffect` hook is employed to watch for changes in the theme (`themeMode`). When the theme mode changes (either dark or light), the class on the HTML element is updated to reflect the selected theme, applying the respective Tailwind CSS classes.
   - The `useEffect` hook re-renders the component whenever the `themeMode` changes.

4. **Theme Button**:
   - The theme button toggles between the light and dark themes. It uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme and change it when clicked.
   - An event handler (`onChange`) checks whether the dark mode should be enabled or not based on the checked status of the button.

5. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   - The dark mode behavior is configured in `tailwind.config.js`. The dark mode feature is enabled via classes (`class` strategy), so the `dark` class must be applied when dark mode is active.

6. **Best Practices**:
   - The code shows two ways to manage context, one where the context is written entirely in one file (with just JavaScript), and another approach where the provider is separated into its own JSX file. Both methods work, but the former is cleaner and easier to manage, especially as the application grows.

7. **Final Thoughts**:
   - While the `Context API` is great for simple applications, larger applications may benefit from using state management libraries like `Redux`. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of understanding the Context API for small projects or for interview scenarios.

This implementation demonstrates how to toggle between light and dark modes using React Context and Tailwind, making it a practical approach for styling and state management in small to medium-sized applications.

## 136. Context API with local Storage
This is a detailed step-by-step explanation of how to build a to-do app using React, Tailwind CSS, and the Context API. Let me summarize the key parts and add insights for each part:

### Overview of the Project
The goal is to build a **To-Do application** with functionalities like adding, updating, deleting, and toggling the completion status of tasks. The project will use **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **Context API** for state management. The primary focus will be on the functionality (not styling) of the app.

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - The project is initialized using **Vite** as the build tool and **React** for the frontend. Tailwind CSS is integrated for styling.
   - The first step is to install necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

2. **Set Up Tailwind CSS**:
   - Tailwind CSS is integrated by modifying configuration files (`tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`) to enable utility-first CSS classes in the project.

3. **Set Up Context API**:
   - A **context** is created to handle the state of the to-dos.
   - Functions like **addToDo**, **updateToDo**, **deleteToDo**, and **toggleToDo** are defined in the context, which will later be used to manipulate the to-do list.

4. **To-Do Context**:
   - The **ToDoContext** holds the state (array of to-dos) and provides methods for modifying the to-do list.
   - The `useContext` hook is used to access the state and methods in any component wrapped by the **ToDoProvider**.

5. **Custom Hook**:
   - A **custom hook** (`useToDo`) is created to simplify accessing the context in any component, which encapsulates the `useContext` logic and avoids redundant imports.

6. **To-Do Provider**:
   - The `ToDoProvider` wraps the components that need access to the to-do context. This ensures that all child components can access and modify the to-do list.

### Code Breakdown

- **Context Setup**: 
  - A `createContext` is used to create a `ToDoContext`, which holds the state of to-dos and defines functions for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling the completion status.
  - An initial state for to-dos is defined as an array of objects, each having an `id`, `message`, and `completed` flag.

- **Context Functions**:
  - **addToDo**: Adds a new to-do by appending it to the beginning of the existing to-dos array. A unique ID can be generated using `Date.now()` or `nano-id`.
  - **updateToDo**: Updates an existing to-do by its ID.
  - **deleteToDo**: Removes a to-do by its ID.
  - **toggleComplete**: Toggles the completion status of a to-do.

- **Provider Component**: 
  - The `ToDoProvider` component wraps the entire app, providing the to-do context to all child components, allowing them to use the context's state and functions.

- **Custom Hook**:
  - The custom hook `useToDo` simplifies the process of accessing the context. This is used inside components that need to interact with the to-do list.

### Development Plan

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Components for adding, displaying, and managing to-dos will be created:
     - A form to add new to-dos.
     - A list to display existing to-dos.
     - Buttons for updating and deleting to-dos.

2. **State Management**:
   - React's **useState** is used to manage the list of to-dos within the component.
   - React Context API will be used to make the to-do state and functions accessible across components.

3. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - The functionality of adding, updating, deleting, and toggling to-dos will be implemented step-by-step, starting with simple state management in the context, and then connecting it to the UI components.

### Conclusion

The project involves several core concepts like **React context**, **state management**, and **Tailwind CSS** for UI design. The approach follows a **modular structure** where each functionality is encapsulated, making it easy to maintain and scale. By using the **Context API**, the state management becomes centralized, allowing any component to access the to-do data and perform actions like adding, updating, or deleting to-dos. 

As you build and complete the project, keep focusing on the functional aspects of the application, ensuring that each feature works correctly and smoothly.

This part of the tutorial focuses on implementing core functionality in a Todo app using React, Context API, and local storage.

### Key Concepts and Implementation Steps:
1. **Update Todo**:
   - The goal is to update the `completed` status or content of a todo. The `updateTodo` function uses `prevToDos` to loop through todos and update the matching `id` of the todo. If the `id` matches, the todo object is updated, otherwise, the existing todo is retained.

2. **Delete Todo**:
   - The `deleteTodo` function works by filtering the todo list. It uses `filter()` to create a new array, excluding the todo item whose `id` matches the provided `id`.

3. **Toggle Complete**:
   - The `toggleComplete` function toggles the `completed` status of a todo. It uses `map()` to loop through todos and updates the `completed` field for the todo with the matching `id`.

4. **Local Storage Integration**:
   - Two `useEffect` hooks are used to handle local storage interactions:
     - One `useEffect` runs when the component loads to load todos from local storage into state, if available.
     - Another `useEffect` updates local storage whenever the todo list changes.

5. **To-Do Form Component**:
   - The form component is a functional React component (`ToDoForm`) that allows the user to input and add new todos. It uses `useState` to manage the input and `useContext` to interact with the Todo context.
   - The form uses a submit handler that calls the `addTodo` method from the context to add a new todo. Upon successful addition, the form input is reset to an empty state.

6. **Visual Design**:
   - The visual structure of the form includes a simple HTML form with an input field for the todo item. CSS classes (e.g., `flex`) are added for styling.

In summary, this segment covers the core functionality of adding, updating, deleting, and toggling todos in the app, along with integrating local storage to persist the data across sessions. The next step is to create the components to render the todo items and integrate them with the existing functionality.

It seems like you've provided a detailed walkthrough of building a React-based To-Do application using **React Context API**, **useState**, **useEffect**, and **localStorage** for state management and persistence. Here's a summary of the key points and steps covered in your explanation:

---

### **1. Context API Setup**
- **Create Context**: 
  - Used `createContext` to create a `TodoContext` for managing the state and functionality of the To-Do application.
  - This context will hold the state (todos) and methods (add, update, delete, toggle) for managing todos.
- **Custom Hook**:
  - Created a custom hook `useTodo` to provide access to the context (`useContext(TodoContext)`).
  - This hook simplifies the process of accessing the context in components.

---

### **2. State Management**
- **State Initialization**:
  - Used `useState` to manage the list of todos.
  - Each todo item has properties like `id`, `message`, and `completed`.
- **Local Storage**:
  - Used `useEffect` to persist todos in `localStorage`.
  - Whenever the `todos` state changes, the `useEffect` hook updates the `localStorage` to keep the data persistent across page reloads.

---

### **3. Core Functionality**
- **Add Todo**:
  - A function to add a new todo to the list. It takes the todo message as input and updates the state.
- **Update Todo**:
  - A function to update an existing todo. It takes the `id` of the todo and the new message.
- **Delete Todo**:
  - A function to delete a todo by its `id`.
- **Toggle Complete**:
  - A function to toggle the `completed` status of a todo.

---

### **4. Components**
#### **TodoForm Component**
- **Purpose**: Allows users to input a new todo.
- **State**:
  - Uses `useState` to manage the input value.
- **Functionality**:
  - On form submission, it calls the `addTodo` function from the context to add the new todo to the list.

#### **TodoItem Component**
- **Purpose**: Displays a single todo item and allows editing, toggling completion, and deletion.
- **State**:
  - Uses `useState` to manage whether the todo is editable (`isTodoEditable`) and the current todo message (`todoMessage`).
- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - If the todo is editable, it displays an input field for editing.
  - If the todo is completed, it disables editing and applies a strikethrough style.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Edit Todo**: Updates the todo message and sets `isTodoEditable` to `false`.
  - **Toggle Complete**: Toggles the `completed` status of the todo.
  - **Delete Todo**: Deletes the todo from the list.

---

### **5. Conditional Rendering and Styling**
- **CSS Classes**:
  - Used Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Applied conditional classes based on the state (e.g., strikethrough for completed todos, border visibility for editable todos).
- **Buttons**:
  - The "Edit" button changes to a "Save" button when the todo is editable.
  - The "Delete" button is always visible and removes the todo when clicked.

---

### **6. App Component**
- **Rendering Todos**:
  - Looped through the `todos` array using `.map()` and rendered a `TodoItem` for each todo.
  - Passed the `todo` object as a prop to each `TodoItem`.
- **Provider**:
  - Wrapped the entire application with the `TodoProvider` to make the context available to all components.

---

### **7. Local Storage Integration**
- **Persisting Data**:
  - Used `localStorage` to save the todos whenever the state changes.
  - On page load, the todos are retrieved from `localStorage` and used to initialize the state.

---

### **8. GitHub Repository**
- The complete code, including CSS and components, is available on GitHub for reference.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Context API**: Provides a way to manage global state without prop drilling.
- **useEffect**: Used for side effects like persisting data to `localStorage`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically changes the UI based on the state (e.g., editable vs. non-editable todos).
- **Local Storage**: Ensures data persistence across page reloads.

---

### **Next Steps**
- In the next video, you plan to start a "mega write summary," which likely involves consolidating the concepts covered so far and diving deeper into advanced React patterns or additional features for the To-Do app.
